This article mainly refers to Francis F. Chen's "Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion". It derives ion waves in plasmas and compares them with electron waves previously discussed. The article is divided into four parts: the first part derives the Boltzmann relation, the second part derives ion waves, the third part analyzes the validity of the plasma approximation, and the last part compares ion waves with electron waves. Any inaccuracies are welcome to be pointed out.

## 1. Derivation of the Boltzmann Relation

Based on the derivation in the previous article "Derivation of Plasma Models from the Boltzmann Equation to Fluid Equations", we can obtain the momentum equation for electrons:

$$ m_en\frac{\partial \mathbf{u_e}}{\partial t} + m_en(\mathbf{u_e} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u_e} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{P_e} - qn(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{u_e} \times \mathbf{B}) = \mathbf{R_e} \quad (1) $$

Now, we make the following assumptions for equation (1): 1. Neglect the collisional drag term, 2. Restrict the dimension to the one-dimensional $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ direction, 3. Ignore the Lorentz force, 4. Neglect the convective term $(\mathbf{u_e} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u_e}$. Thus, the equation can be simplified to:

$$ m_en\frac{\partial {u_{ex}}}{\partial t} = qnE_x - \frac{\partial p_e}{\partial x} \quad (2) $$

Here, $u_{ex}$ and $E_x$ are the components of $\mathbf{u_e}$ and $\mathbf{E}$ in the $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ direction, respectively. According to the ideal gas law:

$$ p = \gamma nKT \quad (3) $$

where $\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats. Substituting equation (3) into equation (2) and rearranging, we get:

$$ \frac{\partial {u_{ex}}}{\partial t} = \frac{qE_x}{m_e} - \frac{\gamma KT_e}{m_en}\frac{\partial n}{\partial x} \quad (3') $$

From equation (3'), it can be seen that the change in electron velocity is mainly caused by two forces: the first term on the right-hand side represents the electrostatic force, and the second term represents the pressure gradient force. This indicates that electrons are accelerated along the magnetic field lines by these two forces.

We make further assumptions for electrons: 1. Since the electron mass is very small, we take $m_e \rightarrow 0$ (for equation (3'), this means the equilibrium state $\frac{\partial {u_{ex}}}{\partial t} = 0$); 2. Electrons are isothermal during motion (due to their extremely high thermal conductivity), i.e., $\gamma = 1$; 3. Let $q = -e$, $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi$. Substituting these into equation (3'):

$$ e\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} = \frac{KT_e}{n}\frac{\partial n}{\partial x} \quad (4) $$

Integrating both sides with respect to $x$, we obtain:

$$ e\phi = KT_e \ln n + C $$

which can be written as:

$$ n = n_0 \exp\left(\frac{e\phi}{KT_e}\right) \quad (5) $$

Equation (5) is the Boltzmann relation. Here, $n_0$ is the reference density at the potential reference point. It shows that on each magnetic field line, electrons maintain a density distribution according to equation (5) under the combined action of the electrostatic force and the pressure gradient force. When electrons cannot cross the magnetic field lines, they will maintain this distribution on each field line.

## 2. Derivation of Ion Waves

For ions, we transform equation (1) into the ion case. Similarly, we ignore the collisional drag term and the magnetic field, restrict it to one dimension, assume it is singly charged, and substitute equation (3) and $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi$ into it, obtaining:

$$ Mn\frac{\partial {u_i}}{\partial t} + Mn(u_i \cdot \nabla)u_i = -en\nabla \phi - \gamma_iKT_i\nabla n \quad (4) $$

Here, $M$ is the ion mass, $T_i$ is the ion temperature, and the plasma approximation $n_i = n_e = n$ is used.

We adopt the same linearization theory as in the derivation of plasma frequency and electron plasma waves:

$$ u_i = u_{i0} + u_{i1}, \quad n = n_0 + n_1, \quad \phi = \phi_0 + \phi_1 \quad (5) $$

where the subscript 0 denotes equilibrium quantities, and 1 denotes oscillation quantities, which take the form $\mathbf{g_1} = \mathbf{g_1} \exp(i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t))$ (for detailed derivation, see the aforementioned article). Substituting these into equation (4) and neglecting second-order oscillation terms, with $u_{i0} = \nabla n_0 = \phi_0 = \nabla \phi_0 = 0$, we get:

$$ Mn_0\frac{\partial u_{i1}}{\partial t} = -en_0\nabla \phi_1 - \gamma_iKT_i\nabla n_1 \quad (6) $$

Taking the derivative of $\mathbf{g_1} = \mathbf{g_1} \exp(i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t))$, we obtain:

$$ Mn_0u_{i1}i\omega = en_0\phi_1 ik + \gamma_iKT_in_1ik \quad (7) $$

According to the Boltzmann relation (equation (5)), we can get the electron density:

$$ n_e = n = n_0 \exp\left(\frac{e\phi}{KT_e}\right) = n_0 \exp\left(\frac{e(\phi_0 + \phi_1)}{KT_e}\right) = n_0 \exp\left(\frac{e\phi_1}{KT_e}\right) \quad (8) $$

Here, $n_0$ is the equilibrium density. Since the oscillation quantity $\phi_1$ is small, we can expand equation (8) using the Maclaurin series:

$$ n_e = n_0\left(1 + \frac{e\phi_1}{KT_e} + \dots\right) \quad (9) $$

Neglecting higher-order terms in the expansion, we get the ion oscillation quantity:

$$ n_{i1} = n_{e1} = n_0\frac{e\phi_1}{KT_e} \quad (10) $$

There will be some error in the plasma approximation, which we will analyze later.

For the continuity equation of ions, similar to electrons, we get:

$$ n_0ku_{i1} = \omega n_1 \quad (11) $$

Combining equations (7), (10), and (11), we get:

$$ \begin{cases} 
Mn_0u_{i1}i\omega = en_0\phi_1 ik + \gamma_iKT_in_1ik \\ 
n_1 = n_0\frac{e\phi_1}{KT_e}\\ 
n_0ku_{i1} = \omega n_1 \\ 
\end{cases} \quad (12) $$

First, we solve $n_1 = \frac{n_0ku_{i1}}{\omega}$ and $\phi_1 = \frac{ku_{i1}KT_e}{e\omega}$, then substitute these into equation (12) to get:

$$ \omega^2 = k^2\left(\frac{KT_e}{M} + \frac{\gamma_iKT_i}{M}\right) \quad (13) $$

Thus, we obtain $\frac{\omega}{k} = \left(\frac{KT_e}{M} + \frac{\gamma_i KT_i}{M}\right)^{1/2} \equiv v_s \quad (14) $.

where $v_s$ is the sound speed in the plasma. Equation (14) is the dispersion relation for ion acoustic waves.

From this equation, it can be seen that ion acoustic waves are constant-velocity waves, with the group velocity equal to the phase velocity, and they only exist when there is thermal motion (i.e., both temperatures are involved). The term $\frac{KT_e}{M}$ provided by the electron temperature is due to the incomplete shielding caused by the thermal motion of electrons, which exposes an electric potential of the order of $\frac{KT_e}{e}$. The second term provided by the ion temperature is due to the diffusion caused by the thermal motion of the ions themselves.

## 3. Analysis of the Validity of the Plasma Approximation

In the derivation above, we not only assumed $n_{i0} = n_{e0} = n_0$, but also $n_{i1} = n_{e1} = n_1$. The former is a basic property of plasmas and its rationality is not discussed here. For the latter, this assumption contradicts $E_1 = -\nabla \phi_1$ in the derivation process (in fact, we often use such an approximation in plasmas, i.e., $n_i = n_e = n$ while $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \neq 0$, instead of using the Poisson equation, because the tendency of plasmas to remain neutral will prioritize balance). Therefore, we need to analyze its validity.

To quantitatively analyze the introduced deviation, we no longer assume $n_{i1} = n_{e1} = n_1$ (all other assumptions remain the same), but instead solve it using the linearized Poisson equation. For the linearized Poisson equation, we have:

$$ \nabla(\mathbf{E_1} + \mathbf{E_0}) = 4\pi e(n_{i0} + n_{i1} - n_{e0} - n_{e1}) $$

which simplifies to:

$$ \nabla \mathbf{E_1} = 4\pi e(n_{i1} - n_{e1}) \quad (15) $$

Since $\mathbf{E_1} = -\nabla \phi_1$, substituting the oscillation form, we get:

$$ k^2 \phi_1 = 4\pi e(n_{i1} - n_{e1}) \quad (16) $$

From the previous section, the Boltzmann linearization gives the electron density oscillation:

$$ n_{e1} = n_0 \frac{e \phi_1}{KT_e} \quad (17) $$

Substituting this into equation (16), we obtain:

$$ \phi_1 \left(k^2 + \frac{4\pi e^2 n_0}{KT_e}\right) = 4\pi e n_{i1} \quad (18) $$

For convenience in calculation, we introduce the Debye length $\lambda_D = \left(\frac{KT_e}{4\pi n e^2}\right)^{1/2}$, resulting in:

$$ \phi_1 \left(k^2 \lambda_D^2 + 1\right) = 4\pi e \lambda_D^2 n_{i1} \quad (19) $$

Substituting equation (19) into equation (12) and replacing the middle equation, we get:

$$ \begin{cases} 
Mn_0 u_{i1} i \omega = en_0 \phi_1 ik + \gamma_i KT_i n_{i1} ik \\ 
\phi_1 (k^2 \lambda_D^2 + 1) = 4\pi e \lambda_D^2 n_{i1} \\
n_0 k u_{i1} = \omega n_{i1} \\ 
\end{cases} \quad (20) $$

Solving equation (20) in the same manner as equation (12), we get $n_{i1} = \frac{n_0 k u_{i1}}{\omega}$ and $\phi_1 = \frac{4\pi e \lambda_D^2}{1 + k^2 \lambda_D^2} \frac{n_0 k u_{i1}}{\omega}$, leading to:

$$ \omega^2 = \frac{k^2}{M} \left(\frac{4\pi n_0 e^2 \lambda_D^2}{1 + k^2 \lambda_D^2} + \gamma_i KT_i\right) \quad (21) $$

Finally, we obtain:

$$ \frac{\omega}{k} = \left(\frac{KT_e}{M} \frac{1}{1 + k^2 \lambda_D^2} + \frac{\gamma_i KT_i}{M}\right)^{1/2} \quad (22) $$

Comparing equation (22) with the previously obtained equation (14), we find that there is an additional factor of $\frac{1}{1 + k^2 \lambda_D^2}$ in the electron temperature term. Since $\lambda_D$ is very small in most experiments, this factor can be approximated as 1 for all but the shortest wavelengths, with no significant impact.

## 4. Comparison of Ion Waves and Electron Waves

If we consider short-wavelength waves (i.e., large $k$, where the factor $\frac{1}{1 + k^2 \lambda_D^2}$ cannot be neglected and is approximated as $\frac{1}{k^2 \lambda_D^2}$), and take the ion temperature $T_i \rightarrow 0$, then according to equation (21), the dispersion relation for ion waves becomes:

$$ \omega^2 = \frac{4\pi n_0 e^2}{M} \equiv \Omega_p^2 \quad (23) $$

Here, $\Omega_p$ is the ion plasma frequency. From equation (23), it can be seen that as $k$ increases, the ion acoustic wave approaches a constant-frequency wave, which is opposite to electron waves. Comparing the two, as shown in Figure 1 (from the main reference book), there is a kind of complementarity between them.
