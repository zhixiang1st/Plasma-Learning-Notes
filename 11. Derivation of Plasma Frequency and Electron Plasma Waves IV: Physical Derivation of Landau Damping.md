## Derivation of Plasma Frequency and Electron Plasma Waves IV: Physical Derivation of Landau Damping

This article builds upon the previous articles in this series. It is divided into four parts: the first part deals with the initial conditions for $n_1$ and $v_1$, the second part derives the wave energy density loss rate, and the third part derives Landau damping.

## 1. Initial Conditions for $n_1$ and $v_1$

As mentioned in the previous articles, initial conditions are crucial for the occurrence of Landau damping. Therefore, we need to find solutions for $n_1$ and $v_1$ that satisfy both the motion equation

$$
m\left(\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x}\right) = -eE_1 \sin(kx - \omega t)
$$

and the continuity equation

$$
\frac{\partial n_1}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial n_1}{\partial x} = -n_u \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x}
$$

while also satisfying the initial conditions, i.e., at $t=0$, $v_1=0$ and $n_1=0$.

Let's start by solving for $v_1$. From the previous article, we have a solution that does not satisfy the initial conditions:

$$
v_1 = -\frac{eE_1}{m} \frac{\cos(kx - \omega t)}{\omega - ku} \quad (1)
$$

Clearly, to satisfy the initial conditions, we need to add a term similar to $-\cos kx$ to the numerator of (1). To satisfy the motion equation, let's assume the added term is $v_{ic}$ (initial coefficient), which satisfies:

$$
m\left(\frac{\partial v_{ic}}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial v_{ic}}{\partial x}\right) = 0 \quad (2)
$$

Thus, $v_{ic}$ should be a function of $kx - kut$, i.e., $v_{ic} = f(kx - kut)$. Therefore, the solution that satisfies the initial conditions is:

$$
v_1 = -\frac{eE_1}{m} \frac{\cos(kx - \omega t) - \cos(kx - kut)}{\omega - ku} \quad (3)
$$

Next, let's consider $n_1$. Similarly, we have a solution that does not satisfy the initial conditions:

$$
n_1 = -n_u \frac{eE_1 k}{m} \frac{\cos(kx - \omega t)}{(\omega - ku)^2} \quad (4)
$$

To satisfy the initial conditions, we need to add a term similar to $\cos(kx - kut)$. To satisfy the continuity equation, let's assume the added term is $n_{ic}$, which satisfies:

$$
\frac{\partial n_{ic}}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial n_{ic}}{\partial x} = -n_u \frac{\partial v_{ic}}{\partial x} = n_u \frac{eE_1 k}{m} \frac{\sin(kx - kut)}{\omega - ku} \quad (5)
$$

Unfortunately, the $\cos(kx - kut)$ term only satisfies $\frac{\partial n_{ic}}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial n_{ic}}{\partial x} = 0$. Therefore, we add an $At \sin(kx - kut)$ term to satisfy both the initial conditions (the offset of $n_1$ at $t=0$ is canceled by the $\cos(kx - kut)$ term) and equation (5). We find $n_{ic} = n_u \frac{eE_1 k}{m} \frac{1}{(\omega - ku)^2} (\cos(kx - kut) + At \sin(kx - kut))$. Substituting this into equation (5) and solving for $A$, we get $A = \omega - ku$. Thus, the solution that satisfies the initial conditions is:

$$
n_1 = -n_u \frac{eE_1 k}{m} \frac{1}{(\omega - ku)^2} \left(\cos(kx - \omega t) - \cos(kx - kut) - (\omega - ku) t \sin(kx - kut)\right) \quad (6)
$$

In summary, we have obtained the solutions for $v_1$ and $n_1$ that satisfy the initial conditions:

$$
\begin{cases}\\
v_1 = -\frac{eE_1}{m} \frac{\cos(kx - \omega t) - \cos(kx - kut)}{\omega - ku} \\
n_1 = -n_u \frac{eE_1 k}{m} \frac{1}{(\omega - ku)^2} (\cos(kx - \omega t) - \cos(kx - kut) - (\omega - ku) t \sin(kx - kut))
\end{cases}
\quad (7)
$$

## 3. Derivation of Wave Energy Density Loss Rate

The wave energy density loss rate is crucial for understanding the damping process. To derive this, we need to analyze the energy transfer between the wave and the particles in the plasma.

The energy density of the wave can be expressed as:

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 E_1^2
$$

where $E_1$ is the amplitude of the electric field of the wave, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

The rate of change of the wave energy density can be derived from the Poynting vector, which describes the energy flow in the electromagnetic field. The Poynting vector is given by:

$$
\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}
$$

For a plane wave in a plasma, the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ is related to the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ by:

$$
\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c} \mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{E}
$$

where $\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector and $c$ is the speed of light. Substituting this into the expression for the Poynting vector, we get:

$$
\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf{E} \times \left(\frac{1}{c} \mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{E}\right)
$$

The time-averaged Poynting vector gives the energy flux of the wave. The energy density loss rate can be related to the divergence of the Poynting vector:

$$
\frac{\partial W}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{S}
$$

For a one-dimensional wave propagating in the $x$-direction, this simplifies to:

$$
\frac{\partial W}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial S_x}{\partial x}
$$

The detailed calculation of the Poynting vector and its divergence involves the specific form of the electric field and the wave dispersion relation. This derivation is complex and requires careful consideration of the plasma parameters and the wave properties.

## 4. Derivation of Landau Damping

Landau damping is a fundamental mechanism in plasma physics that describes the attenuation of waves due to the interaction with particles in the plasma. The key idea is that particles with velocities close to the phase velocity of the wave can absorb energy from the wave, leading to damping.

To derive Landau damping, we start with the linearized Vlasov equation for the distribution function $f_1$:

$$
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial t} + v \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} + \frac{e}{m} E_1 \frac{\partial f_0}{\partial v} = 0
$$

where $f_0$ is the equilibrium distribution function, and $f_1$ is the perturbation due to the wave. Assuming a plane wave solution of the form:

$$
f_1 = f_1(kx - \omega t)
$$

and substituting into the Vlasov equation, we get:

$$
-i\omega f_1 + ikv f_1 + \frac{ieE_1}{m} \frac{\partial f_0}{\partial v} = 0
$$

Solving for $f_1$, we obtain:

$$
f_1 = \frac{eE_1}{m} \frac{\partial f_0}{\partial v} \frac{1}{\omega - kv}
$$

The wave damping rate can be derived from the dispersion relation, which includes the contribution from the particles in the plasma. The dispersion relation for a Langmuir wave in a plasma is given by:

$$
1 + \frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\partial f_0}{\partial v} \frac{dv}{\omega - kv} = 0
$$

where $\omega_p$ is the plasma frequency. The integral in the dispersion relation can be evaluated using the method of residues, which takes into account the poles of the integrand in the complex plane. This leads to the Landau damping rate:

$$
\gamma = \frac{\omega_p^2}{2k^2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\partial f_0}{\partial v} \frac{dv}{(\omega - kv)^2}
$$

The detailed evaluation of this integral depends on the form of the equilibrium distribution function $f_0$. For a Maxwellian distribution, the integral can be evaluated analytically, leading to a damping rate that depends on the wave number $k$ and the plasma parameters.
